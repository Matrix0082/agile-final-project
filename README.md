Honors Peer-graded Assignment: Peer Review: Submit your Work and Review your Peers
In the first part I developed a series of examples, describing the stakeholder and in the second the Store Administrator.

This project allowed me to learn a lot about GitHub, although I found the programming quite difficult.

In my opinion, Agile with Github will allow me to test my programming skills and software development skills.

I chose this course because I am interested in project management and I wanted to deepen my knowledge in this field.

It's great to be able to pursue my passions and learn new things.

I want to change my job to work in IT, marketing or any other field.

I believe my skills in Agile and Scrum will be invaluable in any profession.

I am confident that I can organize and execute my projects effectively and that I can highlight my skills in my CV.

I am sure that this course will open up new job or career advancement opportunities for me, both in the private and public sectors.

In addition to that, this course gives me the opportunity to broaden my knowledge and skills.

I'm excited to explore new tools and better methodologies for project management.
